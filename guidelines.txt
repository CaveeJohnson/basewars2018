Style Guidelines.
To contribute code you must follow these guidelines.

GLUA EXCLUSIVE SYNTAX IS FORBIDDEN.
Do not use 'continue' or any C style alternative operators.

File naming:
	lower_snake.lua
	- There are no exceptions to this excluding where
	  files are required to be named in a specific way
	- .md is preferred over .markdown

Extension naming:
	core.lower-kebab
	lower-kebab-not-core
	- Extensions inside of GM Core must start with core.
	  and all extensions are lower-kebab cased

Variables:
	local local_variable
	ext.memberVariable
	function(paramOne, paramTwo)
	ENUM_VARIABLE
	globaltable
	- There should never be anything global that isn't a table
	- Local variables may be in camelCase but it is preferred as lower_snake
	- Member variables may be in lower_snake but it is preferred as camelCase

Events / hooks:
	ext:HookCallback
	ext:BW_HookCallback
	- Events and hooks are PascalCase


Code best practices.
Once again, these must be followed.

Networking:
	Do not send entities using net.WriteEntity unless you are sure that the
	  receivers will all be active and have received a full update.
	If you are unsure if a player will know of an entities existence, write
	  the entindex and handle it however on the client.

	NEVER WRITE LOCALPLAYER.
	NEVER WRITE 'shared' RESULTS.
	If a result can be generated shared, only send what was used to generate
	  it and NOT what the RESULT was.

	NEVER. TRUST. THE. CLIENT.

Fonts:
	Use Roboto, DejaVu Sans X or built-in fonts. These all come packaged
	(dejavu with the gamemode, roboto with gmod) and are the only fonts
	we can guarantee will exist across all operating systems.

Events / file interaction:
	The hook system exists for a reason, DO NOT CALL OTHER EXTENSIONS
	  UNLESS THAT EXTENSION HAS A DIRECT RETURN.

	Events should never have an 'always return' basis outside of the core.

	Events that make sense only in the context of basewars should be
	  BW_Event, calling non-standard events that do not start with BW_
	  must be part of the core. Listening for them is fine.

	Core extensions may have a subtable inside the basewars global, such as
	  'basewars.raids', and as such, may be called directly, but should still
	  avoid becoming interdependent where possible, and rely on events.

Optimization:
	Optimization is IMPORTANT.
	Consider optimization when DESIGNING THE CODE, and after the fact.
	DO NOT TURN YOUR CODE INTO UNREADABLE TRASH TO OPTIMIZE.

	'ipairs' is used for lists/arrays, 'pairs' for dictionaries/hash tables
	  this is not a matter of optimization, but rather a matter of knowing
	  what type of table it operates on. (also it IS slightly faster)

	If something doesn't NEED to respond in the next frame, don't make
	  it respond in the next frame, make it check for a change every 1-2 seconds.

	Where possible when cleaning or sorting a table, return tbl, count so that
	  the count can be used to avoid doing #tbl.

	Do not localize or cache or do anything else until after you have profiled
	  your code.

	Micro-optimization is reserved for things where macro-optimization cannot be done
	  further or methods that are likely to be called in the range of > 100 times per
	  frame, and once again, only after profiling.

	Micro-optimization is things like localizing math functions on something called 5
	  times per entity per frame and not localizing Entity.SetHealth for a call every
	  	(22 * 5 * edict (lets say 1000) = 110,000 table lookups per second at 22tps)
	  few seconds, that's not an optimization, it's just fucking stupid.

	PROFILE EVERYTHING ON CLIENT AND SERVER.

	Something that takes more than 2ms and gets called more than once per second is
	  unacceptable.
	Something that takes more than 0.5ms and get called per frame is unacceptable.
	ANYTHING that takes more than 5ms is unacceptable, full stop.

	Optimization should be focused on noticeable, measurable impacts, not small
	  improvements. If something 'looks like it performs bad' that doesn't mean
	  it needs optimizing, changes for the sake of changes are unacceptable.

General:
	Never iterate ents.GetAll() per frame. EVER. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!
	Never use ents. ANYTHING PER FRAME. Track entities and then use DistToSqr etc.

	Track entities using the extensions tracker system or by yourself,
	  track the bare minimum you can.

	Use the 'utf8' string functions wherever possible, avoid using string.find,
	  use pattern matches instead.


IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD PLEASE CONSULT @Basewars Core OR @Q2F2 FIRST
AND JUST BECAUSE YOU READ THIS DOENS'T MEAN YOU GET TO MAKE STYLE CHANGES TO OTHER
PEOPLES CODE. ONLY I GET TO DO THAT WHEN I CLEAN UP TECHNICAL DEBT AND DO UNIFICATION.
